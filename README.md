# Constrained-IAR

Integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) is a crucial process when using GNSS based navigation for satellite swarms. This process consists in removing the ambiguity that inherently exist in GNSS carrier phrase measurements. If properly fixed, these measurements can lead to amzing level of accuracies in absolute and relative positionning (mm accuracy)
Core of the code of an inedite IAR algorithm using a priori information on baseline between two satellites I developped while working at SLAB (Space Rendez Vous Laboratory, Stanford University).

I strongly advise to have a look at the slides first.
